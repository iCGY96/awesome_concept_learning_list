# Awesome-Concept-Learning 

Concepts are complex, and often time contains abstract information to be distilled from real-world data. The problem of learning concepts in a complex and dynamic environment is essential to accomplish complex real-world missions. This topic has plausible real-world applications and is gathering much attention in the research community.

Here, we provide a non-exhaustive list of papers that study concept learning.
